# Include Guards

Include guards prevent header files from being included more than once.

We associate a unique macro with each header file.
Typically, this macro is chosen to be the same as the header file's name in all caps with some underscores thrown in.
For example, for `example-file.h` we would use `EXAMPLE_FILE_H`.

Each header file then starts by checking if this macro has already been defined.

* If so, it means the header file has already been included in the past and the rest of the file should be skipped.
* If not, the macro is defined straight away.

In code, it looks as follows:

.example-file.h
[source,language="cpp"]
----
#ifndef EXAMPLE_FILE_H
#define EXAMPLE_FILE_H

// Contents

#endif
----
