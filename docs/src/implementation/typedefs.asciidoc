# Typedefs

{cpp} allows you to define new names for types:

[source,language='cpp']
----
typedef existing_type new_name;
----

For example, this can be used to introduce shorter names:

[source,language='cpp']
----
typedef std::shared_ptr<std::vector<std::string>> strvec;
----

It can also by used to improve readability by having the type better express the intent:

[source,language='cpp']
----
typedef unsigned index;

for ( index i = 0; i != vector.size(); ++i )
{
    ...
}
----

[NOTE]
====
`typedef`s do not define _new_ types.
Internally, the compiler does not distinguish between `unsigned` and `index`.
