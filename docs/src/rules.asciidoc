# Rules

## Asking for Help

* Do not send me code. We have GitHub for that.
* Do not send me screenshots of your code.
* Do not send me pictures of your screen with code on it either.
* In case of a bug, write a minimal test that causes the bug to appear.

## Submitting Your Code

* Your code has to compile in all builds. Remove (or put in comments) all code that does not compile.
* Your code should run both in debug and release build and yield the same results.

## Code

* `#include` your header files using a path relative to the project root.
  For example, say you have a file `frequency-table.h` in a folder `data`.
  You should always use `#include "data/frequency-table.h` to include this header file.
* No `\#pragma once` allowed. Use old fashioned <<implementation/include-guards#,include guards>>.
* Every header file needs an include guard.
* Do *not* ignore warnings.
* No `using namespace` allowed in header files.
* Stay away from `new` and `delete` as much as you can. Stack allocation, `std::make_shared` and `std::make_unique` are your friends.
* No `const_cast`.
* No C-style casts, i.e., use `static_cast<T>`, `dynamic_cast<T>` or `reinterpret_cast<T>` (do pick the right one, not just any one of them), but never `(T)`.
