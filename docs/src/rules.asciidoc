# Rules

## Asking for Help

* Do not send me code. We have GitHub for that.
* Do not send me screenshots of your code.
* Do not send me pictures of your screen with code on it either.
* In case of a bug, write a minimal test that causes the bug to appear.

## Submitting Your Code

* Your code has to compile. Remove (or put in comments) all code that does not compile.

## Code

* No `#pragma once` allowed. Use old fashioned <<implementation/include-guards#,include guards>>.
* Every header file needs an include guard.
* Do *not* ignore warnings.
* No `using namespace` allowed in header files.
* No `const_cast`.
* Stay away from `new` and `delete` as much as you can. Stack allocation, `std::make_shared` and `std::make_unique` are your friends.
